# PRACTICE: SESSION STATE
# =======================


# 1. PRACTICE
'''
Create a simple grocery list for your classes.

1. Your app should have some large title text.

2. Then, you should create a form, and the form should get text input for an
   item to add to a grocery list. (you could do this without a form, but for
   practice using forms, just use a form)

3. When the user hits submit, the item they entered should be added to the list
   and everything currently in the list should be displayed afterwards.

Hint: Remember the best way to do this is to use st.session_state. You should
      create your list inside st.session_state first, but put it inside an if
      statement so it only creates it the very first time your page runs.
