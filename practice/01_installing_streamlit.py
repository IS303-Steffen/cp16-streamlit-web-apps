In the terminal, try to install streamlit and watchdog. Streamlit is what we'll
be using, watchdog just helps it run a little smoother

pip install streamlit watchdog

or if that doesn't work, try

pip3 install streamlit watchdog

print("If this prints, that means you installed streamlit & watchdog correctly")
